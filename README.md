# 📰 News App - Android Jetpack Compose

A simple yet functional News App built using Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, and Kotlin. It fetches the latest top headlines from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and displays them in a scrollable list. This is my **second basic project** as I continue learning and building in the Android development world.

## 📱 Features
